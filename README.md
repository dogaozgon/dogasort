# dogasort

DogaSort is a non-comparison based sorting algorithm that scales with linear time complexity.

Different sorting algorithms are better at working with different data types and use cases. DogaSort performs especially well when we have an integer array input and we want to return a sorted array that has unique values. Note that the initial unsorted array does not have to have unique values. By default, DogaSort removes duplicates and sorts the array simultaneously.
